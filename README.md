# FUJI Cycle Count Sheet Generator

Static inventory-count sheet generator with a searchable master product catalog.

## Master Catalog

The SKU/barcode lookup lazily downloads compressed catalog shards from `master-index/`. To rebuild them after updating the workbook, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_master_search.py "ITEM MASTER AS OF 09-02-2026 1.xlsx" master-index --description-output master-description-index
```

The builder indexes the `HYPERMART` and `GOMART` product sheets, including SKU, UPC, description, supplier, department, and category hierarchy. It also builds a compact description index for the lookup's Description search mode. Keep the original workbook local; the website only needs the generated search shards.

To rebuild only the description index, run:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_master_search.py "ITEM MASTER AS OF 09-02-2026 1.xlsx" --description-only --description-output master-description-index
```

## Hotlist Shift Lookup

`hotlist_inventory.json` defines the hotlist rows and their categories. Replace the demo items with the store's actual SKUs. Keep SKUs as strings to preserve leading zeroes; use `MILK`, `CIGARETTES`, or `LIQUORS` for `category`. Each row includes item details, a direct image URL, and starting count values. Leave `price` and `locator` empty to populate them from the masterfile.

`master-details.json` contains only SKU, price, and locator values and is loaded automatically by catalog search and Hotlist. Rebuild it after replacing the local, gitignored workbook:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_price_locator_index.py
```

The importer joins `Sku` / `Retail Cost` and `sku_no` / `locator_code` columns by SKU and supports multiple locators per SKU. The full workbook remains gitignored; only the reduced mapping is published. Hotlist can still load a workbook manually for browser-local updates. Product photos use each row's direct `image_url` first, then try an exact barcode lookup in Open Food Facts. If neither provides a photo, the card shows a Google Images link for the product. Shift edits are saved locally as you type, and Save Shift Data also logs a complete snapshot to the browser console.

Withdrawal Qty is the cumulative quantity withdrawn so far for the shift. Log Withdrawal transfers only the amount not already applied, so clicking it again does not double-count stock. Serve the project through a static web server (for example, GitHub Pages) so the JSON and catalog files can be fetched.

## Announcements

The login page offers offline local accounts and Firebase online login. Local sessions and announcements stay in this browser profile. Online users authenticate with Firebase Auth and receive their role from `users/{uid}` in Firestore; Firestore rules restrict announcement writes to admins and prevent client-side role changes.

See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for enabling Email/Password Authentication, creating the first admin profile, publishing Firestore rules, and deploying the static site. The Firebase web configuration is public by design; Firestore rules are the authorization boundary. Analytics is not initialized.

## Masterlist View

Open Masterlist from the top navigation and upload a Pcount monitoring workbook. The importer reads `CC Masterlist` plus `CC Sched`, `CC Variance Details`, and `IRA% IRA Summary` when present. Parsed master rows and available secondary sheets are stored in this browser's IndexedDB and restored on reload. The dashboard filters CCD and department, searches SKU/description/vendor fields, sorts by column, and renders 50 or 100 rows per page. Uploaded workbook contents are not uploaded to the website.

## Cigarette Monitoring

Open **Cigarette Monitor** and import the local monitoring workbook. Daily Monitoring and Expiry Lookup are separate tabs. Daily Monitoring reads the `SELLING` sheet in the browser, imports the product list and available daily entries, and lets you save or edit daily `BEG`, `W`, `SALES`, `JDA_S`, `ENDING`, `TRANS#`, `CS1`, `CS2`, `BAG`, and `FMCG` values. After saving a day, review its summary and use **Enter new day** to start the next date with beginning counts carried forward from the saved ending counts. Download the log as CSV for a portable backup. The workbook is not uploaded; products and monitoring entries are saved only in that browser profile.
